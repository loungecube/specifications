# specifications
Specifications for the smøken-cpu.

## principles
The architecture is designed to move certain aspects of concurrency away from the software space and introduce hardware level concurrency and a possibility to add instruction handlers to decrease the possible effects of bottlenecks.

## intent
This repository will contain the specifications for the smøken computer, which is aimed to be an educational microcomputer project that implements some unorthodox features in its architecture. These specifications are meant to be independent of the implementation's word size.

## purpose
The contents of this repository will hopefully be used to implement a fully working microcomputer at the [REDACTED] hackerspace.
